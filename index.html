        <p>A smile is the best makeup any girl can wear.
            Be the reason someone smiles today.
            If you are too busy to smile, you are too busy.
            Never regret something that once made you smile.
            Nothing shakes the smiling heart.
            Nothing you wear is more important than your smile.
            Smile is the beauty of the soul.
            Smile! It increases your face value.</p>
